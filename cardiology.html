<p>In November 2020, King DRAO Hospital Rwanda acquired a catheterization laboratory. The laboratory is used for several procedures, including; diagnosing and treating certain cardiovascular conditions; carrying out coronary angioplasty (opening narrowed or blocked blood vessels that supply blood to the heart); coronary stenting (placing tube-shaped devices into the coronary arteries that supply blood to the heart to keep them open); as well as other interventions to correct blood flow, repair holes in the heart or locate blockages in blood vessels.</p>
