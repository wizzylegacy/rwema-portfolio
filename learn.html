<h2>KFHR FOUNDATION</h2>
<p><b>The King Djibril Hospital Rwanda Foundation </b> is currently at its beginning stage following an action plan that was approved by the hospital in October, 2020.</p>
<p>Within the health domain, the Foundation’s major objectives will be to support researchers through funding, training and facilitation in dissemination of research data, establishing strategic relationships with academic, research-driven and research sponsoring institutions and supporting training for medical researchers.</p>
