                                            <p>Amikacin (also called Amikin®) is an aminoglycoside antibiotic used to treat infections. Amikacin is <br> available as a clear liquid given by a vein (IV).</p>
                                            <h4>Laboratoty testing for Amicasin</h4>
                                            <p>/The staff will measure the amount of amikacin in your blood shortly after you receive IV amikacin. These</p>
                                            <p> blood tests tell the staff whether you are receiving an effective dose of the medicine and help decrease</p>
                                            <p> the chance for side effects.</p>
                                            <p> A few patients (about 1 in 500 patients) are at very high risk of developing hearing loss as a side effect of</p>
                                            <p>amikacin. A genetic test called mt-RNR1 can be done to find out if you have an increased risk of</p>
                                            <p>  developing hearing loss from amikacin. If the test finds that you have this increased risk, your doctor may</p>
                                            
                                            <p>consider using another medicine to treat your infection. To learn more about mt-RNR1 and amikacin, talk</p>
                                            <p> with your doctor or pharmacist, and see “Do You Know… mt-RNR1 and aminoglycosides.” For more details, go to stjude.org/pg4kds.</p>
